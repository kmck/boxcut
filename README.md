Boxcut
======

üì¶‚úÇÔ∏è

Boxcut splits up a Webpack build file into individual modules. It's not perfect, but if you're looking for something like this in the first place, it's probably better than nothing.

Usage
-----

1. Install: `npm install --global boxcut`
2. Cut up your build file `boxcut --input=YOUR-BUNDLE.js --output=PATH/TO/MODULE-OUTPUT`
